It's so dark... Farmer Blue, where are you?!
Where is my wife?!
W-What?! Maddie, you're okay? Farmer Blue didn't do anything?
Wait, Grandpa, you were in on this, too?
That cruel Farmer Blue has done it again!
I have to get to his house as quickly as possible.
I know! I'll use the arrow keys to move.
Hm... I'd better eat some of this cabbage along the way. I'll need my strength if I'm going to fight Farmer Blue.
Hm... I should be able to push these rocks out of the way.
I'd better eat all of this cabbage before moving on.
... ... Who's there?!
Oh, it's just you, Grandpa. Very funny. What are you doing here?
I appreciate that, Grandpa. But this isn't really an old man's game.
Most people know that, Grandpa.
Whoa, look at all those bees!
That's very funny, Grandpa.
Yes, that's nice, Grandpa. We're very fortunate these days.
What? What is it, Grandpa?
Special... cabbages?
I'm worried about my wife, Grandpa.
That's not funny, Grandpa.
Are you doing alright, Grandpa?
No, it's just... I've been eating all of this cabbage, and you haven't had anything to eat.
Grandpa!
I'm working my tail off here! You didn't think to share?
Why do you think there are all these bees underground anyway, Grandpa?
It was?!
My what?!
Or I'll have to use BACKSPACE or ESCAPE to try again. Yes, Grandpa.

Grandpa

Of course, I had to make sure you got here in one piece.
It's me, your fairy godmother.
I heard about your wife. I'm here to help.
Old man?! I was solving cabbage puzzles back when you were in diapers!
You know, if you make a mistake, you can use BACKSPACE to go back.
And if you make a really big mistake, you can use ESCAPE to restart the whole level.
But I'm sure a young'un like you would never make such a big mistake. Heh heh heh.
Did you know that rocks are round?
What do round things do, son?
They roll! Hah!
Careful, son! Watch out for that beehive!
If the beehive falls, the bees will attack you.
If that happens, you'll have to use BACKSPACE or ESCAPE to try again.
Must be a honey convention or something.
Get it? Because bees... and honey...
Hah, I guess you had to BEE there.
You know, back in my day, we didn't have these newfangled 'undo' buttons.
If something attacked me, I had to go back to the last save point. Like a man!
And it wasn't bees either! I used to fight kangaroos! And dinosaurs!
Oh no! Heh heh heh.
It's some of those special cabbages...
Oh, yes, I don't know what fungus growing in them, but they're special all right.
Well, you'll find out when you eat it. Mangia!
Don't worry, son. I'm sure she and Farmer Blue are just... baking a cake together.
For you. A cake for you.
Then get a move on, boy!
That better not be another crack at my age, boy!
Oh, no, I brought my own cabbages. Don't worry about me.
What?!
You didn't ask! Besides, you look like you're having fun!
Ah, a bomb. That takes me back...
Drop this thing off an edge, and watch all your problems go up in smoke.
Just make sure you're not too close to the explosion when it happens.
And it'll hurt. Probably a lot. So just don't do it.
It goes without saying you shouldn't let a bomb blow up any beehives.
Bees are an endangered species! Didn't you know this game was sponsored by the World Wildlife Foundation?
Hah! Not a chance!
But seriously, protect the bees.
I can see Farmer Blue's house up ahead. This should be the last area.
Are you ready for your delicious encounter with the Farmer?
Erm, 'malicious' encounter! Are you ready for your malicious encounter with the Farmer?


Maddie

Dear Marty, I've been kidnapped by the evil Farmer Blue, please hurry to his house immediately! With love, Mrs Maddie Mole
Happy birthday, Marty!
It's your surprise party, sweetie!
Enjoy your cake, sweetie!

Farmer

I'm glad you made it here, Marty.
Do anything? Maddie just came over and needed some sugar for the cake.
